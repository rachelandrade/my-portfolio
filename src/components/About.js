                    I’m a passionate web developer with a strong focus on building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly
                    web applications. What started as a curiosity for how things work on the web quickly turned into a
                    rewarding journey of solving problems through clean, efficient code.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I’m proficient in modern frameworks like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular </strong>
                    for the frontend, as well as <strong>Node.js</strong> for building scalable and efficient backend services.
                    I also enjoy working with styling tools like <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>SCSS</strong> to craft interfaces that are both
                    visually appealing and accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas turn into impactful products, and I’m always
                    eager to learn, adapt, and grow with emerging technologies. Whether it’s building full-stack applications
                    from scratch or optimizing existing systems, I’m excited to contribute to projects that push the web forward.
